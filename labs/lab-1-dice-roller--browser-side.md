## Challenge

A browser-side application that has you reimplement [Lab 1](https://github.com/sashimii/JSLearningLabs/blob/master/labs/lab-1-dice-roller.md) as a browser-side application.

## Learning Outcomes
* Reading from DOM with JavaScript
* Writing to DOM with JavaScript
* Understanding differences between NodeJS and Browser APIs 
* Learning how to use `<script>` tags


## Expected Outcome 

As a user, I should be able to: 
* select the sides of a die from a dropdown list, 
* type in the number of times I want to roll the selected die, 
* press a button that simulates the dice roll and updates the DOM with the result

The dice configuration should be a standard set of D&D dice:  D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20

If the user has not selected a die, or typed in a number for the amount of times they wish to roll one, show an error.

### Bonus Points: 
* an option for rolling advantage or disadvantage 

## Remember

* You are writing your code for others, not just yourself
* Make sure your code is presentable and readable
* Use variable names that are easily understood
* Include comments where you feel your intent is not easily conveyed by variable names and code structure alone 

## Resources
* You don't need any extra libraries. Build for the latest chrome or firefox. No need for fancy babel.
* Take a look at [HTML DOM Object documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp) and play around with it
